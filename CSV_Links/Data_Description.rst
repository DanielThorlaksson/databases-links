File Structure
==============
On this page you can find the link files we produced to the best of our knowledge.

The dataset links are based on glaciers in a "starting" inventory. Further columns are some metadata mostly extracted from WGMS FoG 2014 (Attention: sometimes the coordinates are outdated!). The file naming is the following:

|

**<starting_inventory>_<region>_to_<inventory\ :sub:`1`\ >_..._<inventoryn>_<YYYmmdd>.csv**

|

At the moment, <region> can be either "ALPS" or "WORLD" and <YYYYmmdd> is the date the file was completed and issued.

The files are regular comma-separated CSVs with a header line and an unnamed internal column which you can just ignore. Important are the ``status`` and ``remark`` columns: if the ``status`` is set to ``True``, we believe that our findings are correct and can be used like this. If ``False``, there is an ambiguity concerning this glacier - this might also be that there are for example **multiple RGI polygons** belonging to one ID of the starting inventory.

Please help us to improve the links!
====================================

The internet is really a great source of knowledge, but still not everything is available online. For this, we also rely on *YOUR* expertise. So, please, if you find any error, have ideas to improve our findings or are able to contribute a new link, just let us know by writing an e-mail to `johannes.landmann[at]student.uibk.ac.at`_
